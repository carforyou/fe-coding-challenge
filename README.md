# CAR FOR YOU coding challenge

We've set up this repository for you so you can focus on solving the challenge instead of repeating new project setup boilerplate.

This setup is pretty close to what we use in our daily jobs, feel free to use as much of the provided tools as possible and change (or completely ignore) ones you want (e.g. if you'd rather write javascript just use `js` or `jsx` as the file extension).

## What will you need?

- a computer you can work on
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- your favourite editor
- network connection
- around 3-4 hours of time

## How to start

Download the project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/carforyou/fe-coding-challenge.git
```

You can use the `Download Zip` button too, the advantage of using `git` is that you can show us the intermediate states of your work and a bit of your process.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser for further instructions.

## Some helpful links and documentation
You don't need to read all of these, but they might be helpful if you'd like to know more about the tools we use. As mentioned above - it's okay to ignore any pre-installed dependencies and move forward with another tool you're more comfortable with.
